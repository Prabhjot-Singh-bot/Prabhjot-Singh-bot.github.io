        In addition to my interest in software engineering, I have a keen passion for sports, especially football.
        Since childhood, I have been actively engaged in various sports activities, such as basketball and cricket.
        Iâ€™ve even won several certificates in intra-school basketball tournaments. My friends have always encouraged me 
        to participate in more tournaments, which has fueled my love for sports.

        After changing schools in the 6th grade, I also participated in volleyball, where I had the opportunity to play at the district level.
        Furthermore, I was introduced to one of the greatest football players in history, Cristiano Ronaldo, who has had a tremendous influence on me.
        His athleticism, hard work, determination, and never-give-up attitude continue to inspire me.

        In addition to sports, I have a passion for music and traveling. I particularly enjoy listening to old folk and country music from different parts of India.
        I have traveled to several beautiful places, including:

        <ul> <li>Nainital</li> <li>Ladakh</li> <li>Kashmir and Jammu</li> <li>Goa</li> </ul>
        I also love listening to ghazals in my spare time.
